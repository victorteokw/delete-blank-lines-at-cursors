VSCode plugin that provides deleting blank lines at cursors functionality.

These are from emacs help:

Lisp function in `simple.el'. It is bound to C-x C-o. (delete-blank-lines)

* On blank line, delete all surrounding blank lines, leaving just one.
* On isolated blank line, delete that one.
* On nonblank line, delete any immediately following blank lines.
